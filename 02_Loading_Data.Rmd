## Loading Data
We can load data into R using some more built-in functions, and by default *R* imports each file as a `data.frame`.
*R* expects to see some kind of delimiter it can use to make columns, and these can be:

1. commas (e.g. a .csv file)
2. tabs (e.g a .tsv file)
3. spaces
4. semi-colons, or whatever was used to create the file.

Fortunately RStudio helps us do this by providing the "Import Dataset" button.

Let's load the dataset `toothData.csv` which is in the `data` directory.

1. Click the Import Dataset button, then `From Text File...`
2. Navigate to the `data` folder
3. Select the file `toothData.csv`

Now a preview screen has appeared, with numerous options.

![The Preview Screen](figure/Preview.png)

1. The top section (blue) contains a preview of the raw data file
2. The bottom section (red) contains the `data.frame`as it would appear in *R*.
3. On the LHS we have numerous options for the data. 
    + Do we have column names (i.e. a heading)?
    + Do we have row names?
    + What is the delimiter?
    + What value should *R* give to missing values?
    + Should any text columns be converted to a `factor`?
  
**Try changing a few to see what effect they have on the** `data.frame` **preview**

Now load the data, and a spreadsheet-like preview will appear.
This is a familiar viewpoint, which we can close anytime.

**Two important points**

1. Using this method will give the *R* object, the same name as the file name, i.e. `toothData`
2. Notice that this has generated two lines of code. If using this method, **ALWAYS** copy the first line to your R script.

## Loading Data Without Using a GUI
We can also load data, using the functions `read.csv`, `read.table` or `read.delim`.
The code generated by the GUI will have used one of these.
```{r,eval=FALSE}
?read.table
```
All of the options we saw on the LHS of the GUI are listed here as function arguments.
Note that for `read.csv` there are default values set such as `header=TRUE`, `sep=","`.
Using these defaults, we could have also loaded the file using the following command.
```{r}
toothData <- read.csv("data/toothData.csv")
```
