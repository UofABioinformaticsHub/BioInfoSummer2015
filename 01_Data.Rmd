## Why use R?
R offers numerous advantages over Excel, GraphPad Prism & the like:  

- Can handle extremely large datasets  
- Complex processes come as inbuilt functions  
- _We have code to record and repeat our analysis_

We need to understand a little about:  

- Data Types  
- Data Structures  
- Functions  

We will also briefly touch on:  

- Reading data into R
- Visualising Data
- The package _clueR_

## The R Environment
In the R Environment, we can create objects of multiple types.
We usually give them a name, and they are only visible when we enter the object name in the _Console_.
```{r}
x <- 5
x
```

It's like a desk (or Workspace) where we can leave things out of view until we need them.
In RStudio, the _Environment_ tab in the top right shows what's currently in our Environment.

Nothing is saved to disk, until we save the complete Environment as an _.RData_ object.


## Data Types

**What is the difference between these two?**

- 7
- "7"  

The first represents the value 7, whilst the second is the character that we use to represent this in text.
To your computer these mean different things!

Excel will automatically try to convert "7" to the value 7, but automatic conversion can be troublesome.
(Try entering the gene names for SEPT9, DEC1, FEB2 etc. into Excel.)
In R we maintain control over this delineation.

## The Basic Data Types
The basic data types in R are:

logical (TRUE or FALSE)
```{r}
x > 1
```

integer
```{r}
sampleSize <- 6
```

double (also known as "numeric")
```{r}
meanLifeSpan <- 2.05
```

character
```{r}
species <- "mouse"
```

__When would you need an integer rather than a double?__

## Vectors
R sees everything as a _vector_
These are like columns in a spreadsheet, where we have entries in multiple cells.
```{r}
lifeSpans <- c(2.1, 1.9, 1.7, 1.8, 2.3, 2.5)
lifeSpans
```
This is a _numeric_ vector.

We can perform simple operations on a vector by using some in-built functions.
```{r}
meanLifeSpan <- mean(lifeSpans)
meanLifeSpan
```

**Try some other functions**  
Some examples may be sd(), var(), max(), min(), median(), summary()

**Could we apply these functions to integer vectors?**  
**What about character vectors?**

Every vector also has a length attribute, which is just the number of entries in the vector.
```{r}
sampleSize <- length(lifeSpans)
sampleSize
```

## Subsetting Vectors
We can extract single values, or sets of values, from a vector by using square brackets
```{r}
lifeSpans[1]
lifeSpans[4:6]
```


## Factors
One other data type we see in R is a _factor_.
R will sometimes assume that any character strings represent categorical variables.
```{r}
Groups <- c("treated", "control", "control", "control", "treated", "treated")
Groups <- factor(Groups)
Groups
```

These can be a trap for the unwary, as behind the scenes R has saved these as the integers, corresponding to which category (_or factor level_) the values belong to.
```{r}
as.integer(Groups)
```
In one sense, these are like a hybrid of an integer vector, with a character vector included which contains the various category names.
In the old days of puny computers, this was more memory efficient.
It also makes sense when you consider statistical modelling is the heart of R.
