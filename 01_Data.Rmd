## Why use R?
R offers numerous advantages over Excel, GraphPad Prism & the like:  

- Can handle extremely large datasets  
- We can perform complex analytic precedures
- Many processes come as inbuilt functions  
- _We have code to record and repeat our analysis_

With this extra capability, we need to understand a little about:  

- Data Types  
- Data Structures  
- Functions  

We will also briefly touch on:  

- Reading data into R
- Visualising Data
- The package _clueR_

## The R Environment
In the R Environment, we can create objects of multiple types.
We first give them a name (e.g. `x`) and then assign a value to it using the `<-`symbol.
This is like an arrow putting the value into the object.
*R* objects are only visible when we enter the object name in the _Console_.
```{r}
x <- 5
x
```

It's like a desk (or Workspace) where we can leave things out of view until we need them.
In RStudio, the _Environment_ tab in the top right shows what's currently in our Environment.

Nothing is saved to disk, until we save the complete Environment as an _.RData_ object.


## Data Types

**What is the difference between these two?**

- 7
- "7"  

The first represents the value 7, whilst the second is the character that we use to represent this in text.
To your computer these mean different things!

Excel will automatically try to convert "7" to the value 7, but automatic conversion can be troublesome.
(Try entering the gene names for SEPT9, DEC1, FEB2 etc. into Excel.)
In R we maintain control over this delineation.

## The Basic Data Types
The basic data types in R are:

logical (TRUE or FALSE)
```{r}
x > 1
```

integer
```{r}
sampleSize <- 6
```

double (also known as "numeric")
```{r}
meanLifeSpan <- 2.05
```

character
```{r}
species <- "mouse"
```

__When would you need an integer rather than a double?__

## Vectors
R sees everything as a _vector_
These are like columns in a spreadsheet, where we have entries in multiple cells.
Importantly, _every entry must be of the same data type_!
```{r}
lifeSpans <- c(2.1, 1.9, 1.7, 1.8, 2.3, 2.5)
lifeSpans
```
This is a _numeric_ vector, where all entries are double precision entries (i.e. they have decimal points).  
**What would happen if we accidentally included the letter "a" in this vector?**

We can perform simple operations on a vector by using some in-built functions.
Functions in R, consist of their name, followed by the round braces `()`.
We pass an *R* object to the function, by including it inside these braces.
```{r}
mean(lifeSpans)
```

**Try some other functions**  
Some examples may be sd(), var(), max(), min(), median(), summary()

**Could we apply these functions to integer vectors?**  
**What about character vectors?**

In the above, we just printed the reults to the screen.
Sometimes we may want to save the results as a new *R* object.
For example, every vector also has a length attribute, which is just the number of entries in the vector, and this can be how we find out our sample size.
```{r}
sampleSize <- length(lifeSpans)
sampleSize
```

## Subsetting Vectors
We can extract single values, or sets of values, from a vector by using square brackets
```{r}
lifeSpans[1]
lifeSpans[4:6]
```


## Factors
One other data type we see in R is a _factor_.
R will sometimes assume that any character strings represent categorical variables.
```{r}
Groups <- c("treated", "control", "control", "control", "treated", "treated")
Groups <- factor(Groups)
Groups
```

These can be a trap for the unwary, as behind the scenes R has saved these as the integers, corresponding to which category (_or factor level_) the values belong to.
```{r}
as.integer(Groups)
```
In one sense, these are like a hybrid of an integer vector, where the values represent the category number, and a character vector which contains the various category names.
In the old days of puny computers, this was more memory efficient.
It also makes sense when you consider statistical modelling is at the heart of R.

## Data Frames
One of the most common data structures in R is a `data.frame`.
These are very similar to a spreadsheet in Excel, and we have columns with information in them.
*Each column must be the same length!*
```{r}
mouseLife <- data.frame(lifeSpans, Groups)
mouseLife
```

Note how R automatically named the columns.
We could also specify these manually.
 
```{r}
mouseLife <- data.frame(lifeSpans, Groups,
                        sex  = c("M", "M", "M", "F", "F", "F"))
mouseLife
```

We can easily subset a `data.frame` based on values in a column.

```{r}
subset(mouseLife, sex =="M")
```

We can also call a column individually, using the `$` symbol followed by the column name.

```{r}
mouseLife$Groups
```
