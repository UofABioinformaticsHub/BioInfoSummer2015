## Introduction

The R programming language provides an effective environment for making sense of data that enables us to address various biological questions. 
In this introduction course, we will illustrate exploratory data analysis that involves calculating numerical and graphical summaries. 
More specially, we will cover installation of R packages, writing basic R functions and examine various visualization tools.  
For more intermediate participants in the course we will examine more complex visualization tools.

## Outline
- R data types and operations
- Read data in R and exploratory data analysis
- Install package and calling functions from packages
- Write your own functions
